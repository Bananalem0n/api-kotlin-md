**quickie** is a Quick Response (QR) Code scanning library for Android that is based on CameraX and ML Kit on-device barcode detection. It's an alternative to ZXing based libraries and written in Kotlin. quickie features:
- Easy API for launching the QR scanner and receiving results by using the new Activity Result API
- Modern design, edge-to-edge scanning view with multilingual user hint
- Android Jetpack CameraX for communicating with the camera and showing the preview
- ML Kit Vision API for best, fully on-device barcode recognition and decoding

There are two different flavors available on `jcenter()`:

| Bundled                             | Unbundled                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ML Kit model is bundled inside app (independent of Google Services) | ML Kit model will be automatically downloaded via Play Services (after app install) |
| additional 1.1 MB size per ABI (you should use AAB or ABI splitting) | smaller app size |
| V2 barcode model is used (possibly faster, more accurate) | currently V1 will be downloaded
```kotlin
// bundled:  
implementation("com.g00fy2.quickie:quickie-bundled:0.5.2")

// unbundled:
implementation("com.g00fy2.quickie:quickie-unbundled:0.5.2")
```

## Quick Start
To use the QR scanner simply register the `ScanQRCode()` ActivityResultContract together with a callback during `init` or `onCreate()` lifecycle of your Activity/Fragment and use the returned ActivityResultLauncher to launch the QR scanner activity.
```kotlin
val scanQrCode = registerForActivityResult(ScanQRCode(), ::handleResult)

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    …
    binding.button.setOnClickListener { scanQrCode.launch(null) }
}

fun handleResult(result: QRResult) {
    …
```
⚠️ **You can't register the ActivityResultContract inside the OnClickListener lambda. This will fail since the code gets executed after the onCreate lifecycle!**

Check out the [samples](https://github.com/G00fY2/quickie/tree/develop/sample) inside this repo or visit the [Activity Result API documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result) for more information.

#### Responses
The callback you add to the `registerForActivityResult` will receive a subclass of the sealed `QRResult` class: 

1. `QRSuccess` when ML Kit successfully detected a QR code
   * wraps a `QRContent` object
1. `QRUserCanceled` when the activity got canceled by the user
1. `QRMissingPermission` when the user didn't accept the camera permission
1. `QRError` when CameraX or ML kit threw an exception
   * wraps the `exception`

#### Content
The content type of the QR code detected by ML Kit is wrapped inside a subclass of the sealed `QRContent` class which always provides a `rawValue`.

Currently, supported subtypes are:
`Plain`, `Wifi`, `Url`, `Sms`, `GeoPoint`, `Email`, `Phone`, `ContactInfo`, `CalendarEvent`

See the ML Kit [Barcode documentation](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/mlkit/vision/barcode/Barcode#nested-class-summary) for further details.

### Customization
The library is designed to behave and look as generic as possible. Currently, it's not possible to change the UI, but there are plans to add customizations in future releases.

## Release state
**quickie** relies on Google Jetpack libraries which are in pre-release state. CameraX has no stable release version yet and the Activity Result API is part of the latest AndroidX Activity and Fragment release candidates. Here is what Google says about this release state:
* A release candidate is a prospective stable release.
* It may contain critical last-minute fixes.

You should consider **quickie** to be in pre-release state too. I will raise the version to 1.0 once all dependent libraries hit stable.

## Requirements
* AndroidX
* Min SDK 21+
* (Google Play Services available on the end device if using `quickie-unbundled`)
